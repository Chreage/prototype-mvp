=============

prototype minimum viable product


* The MVP of Chreage is a list spatializer

For any list in entry, it returns a L-System that maps the contents as Spheres of diminishing radius in 2D

MVP 1.xxx will be L-Systems mapped in 2D, of increasing detail, assymetry, complexity and fetching the top Alexa Websites

MVP 2.xxx will consist of adding volume to the 2D mappings, e.g. by using simplex noise parametered to the Alexa rankings

* In parallel, one could start embedding Chromium in the interface. Versions embedding chromium using the CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) will be called ".CEF"
* the CEF's webpage can be found here https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/


* Once the Persistant world is generated, we will need to apply the list spatializer within domains (eg TED, Wikipedia, Youtube etc.). For example, the Wikipedia domain will be a space where any search will return a L-system mapping the results.
